# Advanced _R_ and _Bioconductor_

Instructors: Martin Morgan, Herve Pages<br />
Date: June 19-20, 2017<br />
Location: University of Zurich

This course covers details of _R_'s evaluation, vector representation,
garbage collection, C interface, and S3 and S4 approaches to complex
data representation. The course is meant to provide attendees with the
knowledge and confidence to confront _R_ behavior and programming
challenges. Participants should be very comfortable with _R_ syntax;
ideally they will have experience writing _R_ packages, basic
familiarity with S3 and / or S4 object systems, and have at least
thought about tackling C-level implementations of complicated
algorithms. The course includes discussion of _Bioconductor_'s S4
object system, offering insight into using and designing data
representations for large and complex data.

- [Preparation][] (Optional)

Part 1: [Inside the mind of _R_][] (Day 1)

- _R_ as we know it -- why it behaves the way it does
- Inner _R_: understanding the _C_ API and implementation

Part 2: [Nouns and verbs][] (Day 1 and 2)

- _R_ data and programs: vectors, classes, functions and methods
- Essential _Bioconductor_ classes: implementation and extension

Part 3: [Doing it better][] (Day 2)

- Directions in _R_ and software development

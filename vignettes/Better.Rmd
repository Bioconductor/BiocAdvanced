# Classic, tidy, rich data representations

# Packages

- Olde school / new school documentation
- Tests
- Dependencies

# Continuous Integration

Continuous integration of your package on both Linux and Windows platforms
via (mostly) GitHub webhooks

- [Travis-CI][]: Linux setup for continuous integration
- [AppVeyor][]: Windows instance for package testing
(available for 32 & 64 bit architectures)
- [Wercker][]: Docker-container-based integration option may work with
already available Bioconductor Docker images
- [Codeship][]: Supports bitbucket
- [R-Hub][]: Integrated with R, still in development

The first three work with package-level YAML files to setup an integration
environment. Cost-effective options for testing your package.

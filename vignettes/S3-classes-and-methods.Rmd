# Building blocks

```{r}
x <- rnorm(1000)
y <- x + rnorm(1000)
df <- data.frame(Independent = x, Dependent = y)
fit <- lm(Dependent ~ Independent, df)
anova(fit)
```

Atomic vectors

- `logical()`, `integer()`, `numeric()`, `complex()`, `raw()`, `character()`

Attributes

```{r}
x <- structure(list(), class="Foo")
attributes(x)
.Internal(inspect(x))
```

- Attributes in C: pair list

An implicit class -- `matrix()`

`list()` and `environment()`

- recursive
- `environment()`: reference semantics

Plain-old-functions

- First class objects

# The S3 object system

Class

- Definition -- list (usually) or atomic vector with `class` attribute
- Inheritance: _is-a_ and _has-a_
    - linear hierarchy

```{r}
People <- function(name = character(), age = numeric()) {
    stopifnot(
        is.character(name), is.numeric(age), all(age > 0),
        length(name) == length(age)
    )
    structure(list(name=name, age=age), class = "People")
}

Employees <- function(people = People(), job = character()) {
    stopifnot(
        identical(class(people), "People"), is.character(job),
        length(people) == length(job)
    )
    employees <- people
    employees$job <- job
    class(employees) <- c("Employees", class(employees))
    employees
}

Company <- function(company_name = character(), employees = Employees()) {
    stopifnot(
        is.character(company_name), length(company_name) == 1L,
        !is.na(company_name),
        inherits(employees, "Employees")
    )
    structure(
        list(
            company_name = company_name,
            employees = employees
        ),
        class = "Company"
    )
}
```

Generic

```{r}
description <- function(object, ...)
    UseMethod("description")
```

Method

```{r}
description.People <- function(object, ...)
    sprintf("%s; age %s", object$name, object$age)

description.Employees <-
    function(object, ...)
{
    person_description <- NextMethod()
    sprintf("%s; job %s", person_description, object$job)
}
```

- 'Next' methods
- 'Group' generic methods

Strengths & weakneses

- (+) Easy to implement `structure(list(), class="Foo")`
- (+, usually) Simple inheritance (linear) and dispatch (single)
- (-) No guarantee of structure, or separation of 'implementation'
  from 'interface'

# Exercises

**Exercise:** `name()` and `age()` accessors

The `Person` class has fields `name` and `age`. These are accessible
by reaching in to the implementation details and extracting the list
element, e.g., `Person()$name`. But this type of direct manipulation
is considered bad practice; it is better to have 'accessors' that
define the 'application programming interface (API)' for accessing
information from the object. Write plain-old-functions (e.g., like
`name <- function(x) ...`) to extract name and age.

<!--
Answer:

```{r}
name <- function(x)
    x$name

age <- function(x)
    x$age
```
-->

**Exercise:** `length()` S3 method

`?length` indicates that this function is a (S3) generic. Define an S3
`length` method for the `People` class; note that we use this when
validating the input to `Employees()`.

<!--
Answer:

```{r}
length.People <- function(x)
    length(name(x))
```
-->

**Exercise:** S3 generics and methods

Revise `name()` and `age()` to be S3 generics and methods. Reflect on
the beneifts and costs of plain-old-functions versus generic +
methods.

<!--
Answer:

```{r}
name <- function(x)
    UseMethod("name")

name.Person <- function(x)
    x$name

age <- function(x)
    UseMethod("age")

age.Person <- function(x)
    x$age
```
-->

**Exercise:** (Return here after S4 presentation)

Re-implement the `People`, `Employees`, and `Company` S3 example in
S4. Compare and contrast. S4 is often viewed as verbose; is the S4
implementation longer or more complicated than the S3 implementation?

<!--
Answer:

```{r}
People <- setClass(
    "People",
    slots = c(name = "character", age = "numeric")
)

setValidity("People", function(object) {
    if (!identical(length(name(object)), length(age(object)))) {
        "lengths of name() and age() differ"
    } else TRUE
})

Employees <- setClass(
    "Employees",
    contains = "People",
    slots = c(job = "character")
)

setValidity("Employees", function(object) {
    if (!identical(length(employees(object)), length(jobs(object)))) {
        "length of employee() and job() differ"
    } else TRUE
})

Company <- setClass(
    "Company",
    slots = c(company_name = "character", employee = "Employees")
)

setValidity("Company", function(object) {
    if (length(company_name) != 1 || !is.na(company_name)) {
        "company_name must be length 1 and not NA"
    } else TRUE
})
```

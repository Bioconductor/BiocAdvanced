# _R_ as we know it

## Memory management

Copy on change

Garbage collection

Performance consequences

## Symbol resolution and evaluation

Environments

Lexical scope

Evaluation, lazy and non-standard evaluation

## Practical techniques

Correctness

Performance

Debugging beyond `debug()`

# Finding the inner _R_: the C API and implementation

## Behind the curtain

From _R_ to C

S-expressions

The public API

## Old-school approaches to foreign langauges

When to worry?

- Access third-party libraries
- Novel algorithms
- Simpler reasoning
- Copy-free operations

`.C()`

`.Call()`

## Rcpp

## Into the weeds

Fun (?!) with `gdb`
